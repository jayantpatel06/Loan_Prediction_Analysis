🏦 Loan Prediction Analysis

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for predicting loan approval status using machine learning models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and performance visualization.


📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the Loan Prediction Problem and contains applicant details such as income, employment status, credit history, loan amount, and more.

🔧 Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - Handled missing values using mean (numerical) and mode (categorical).
  - Performed log transformation to normalize skewed distributions.
  - Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns.
- Feature Engineering
  - Created Total_Income by combining applicant and co-applicant income.
  - Applied log transformations to skewed features.
-Label Encoding
  - Converted categorical variables to numerical using LabelEncoder.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized categorical distributions using count plots.
  - Assessed numerical features using histograms and KDE plots.
  - Examined feature correlations using a heatmap.
- Model Training & Evaluation
  - Trained and compared three models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
  - Evaluated using:
    - Accuracy
    - AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - Cross-validation score
  - Visualized ROC curves and confusion matrices.

🧪 Models & Evaluation

Each model was trained using train_test_split and evaluated on:
- Test Accuracy
- Mean Squared Error
- AUC Score
- Cross-Validation Accuracy

ROC curves and confusion matrices were plotted to provide deeper insight into model performance and classification balance.

📈 Visualizations
- Count plots for categorical features
- Histograms for numerical/log-transformed features
- Correlation heatmap
- ROC Curve comparison
- Confusion matrices for each classifier
